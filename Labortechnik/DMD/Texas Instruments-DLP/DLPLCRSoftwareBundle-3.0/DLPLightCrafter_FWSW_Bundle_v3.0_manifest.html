<br><br><br>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2<br><br>                       Version 2, June 1991<br><br> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>                            Preamble<br><br>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors' reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.

In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9.

It also counts<br> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br> the version number 2.1.]<br><br>                            Preamble<br><br>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br><br>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>introduced by others.<br><br>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>the library.<br><br>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>special circumstances.<br><br>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>system.<br><br>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>that program using a modified version of the Library.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br><br>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br><br>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>and installation of the library.<br><br>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>and what the program that uses the Library does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>Library.<br><br>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br><br>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>    its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>    root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Library.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>these notices.<br><br>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br><br>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>of these things:<br><br>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>    to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>    specified materials from the same place.<br><br>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>the executable.<br><br>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>distribute.<br><br>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>    Sections above.<br><br>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Library or works based on it.<br><br>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>this License.<br><br>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>implemented by public license practices.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>DAMAGES.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br><br>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>ordinary General Public License).<br><br>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><br><br>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
